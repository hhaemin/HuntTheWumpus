You have entered a cave to capture the monster Wumpus.
The cave consists of 20 rooms.
Each room has a passage leading to 3 other rooms.

risk factors

pit:
- Two rooms have pits. This pit is so deep
that once you fall you can't get out.
-Rooms with pits have subtly different airflow.

bat :
- There are big bats in the three rooms
- If you enter this room, the bat will grab you
and throw you into another room and fly away.
- Keep in mind that there may be other hazards
in the room you are thrown into.
- Bats always rub their wings, even when not moving.

Wumpus:
- Wumpus is a monster that emits a terrible smell
and is not affected by the dangers in the cave.
- He has sucker feet and a body too large for a bat to lift.
- Wumpus are mostly asleep.
- If you shoot the wrong arrow or enter the room with the Wumpus,
he will wake up.
- After the Wumpus wakes up, he has a 75% chance to move to another room,
and if you and the Wumpus are in one room, he will grab you and eat you.

*you

Each turn you can move to another room connected
to your current room or shoot an old arrow.
If you use up all five arrows and don't catch the Wumpus,
you will fail the hunt.
